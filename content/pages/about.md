## Professional

Since as early as I remember I have wanted to work with computers. When I was a kid I didn't know what exactly I wanted to do but I knew it would involve computers. I went through the "I want to be a game developer phase" but eventually I was happy to leave that behind as a hobby and start exploring web development. I then started messing with HTML back in the days when tags were capitalized and framesets were cool. We have come a long way since then and I am very happy to keep developing my skills along with new technology. PHP, HTML, and Javascript are currently my specialties but I always make it a point to mess with new tech when I can. My current pet project is learning Polymer and Go. I always strive to keep learning whenever I can, from taking on new projects to going to meetups to see what the new cool tech is and if I can use it for something neat.

## Personal

I am a pretty laid back person. I love to hang out and watch TV or play games after a long day working. I enjoy getting out during the weekends to do something active like hiking, biking, or just exploring new neighborhoods. I also enjoy a good board game with friends whenever I can. I grew up in Pasadena and moved to San Francisco for college, sticking around the Bay for 10 years. It was a great place to live and work but I am happy to have a home in Sacramento, California. I live there currently with my beautiful wife and two cats.
