After a recommendation from a friend I decided to take a look into [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Hugo is a blog framework built on Go. I have been trying to find projects in Go so I can learn more about it so this seemed like a good start. I decided to take down my old site which was just a resume and profile for a blog. I've had prior experience with Drupal and Wordpress - they are great platforms, but I wanted something with less bloat so I decided to go with Hugo.

## Install

Installing Hugo was very straight forward. [Brew](http://brew.sh/) makes life much easier.

## Code

Coding took a little while to figure out but the documentation is pretty good and once you get started things are fairly simple. Unless you really need or want to, Hugo abstracts a lot of the code, almost all of it, from creating and managing a blog. It is a little more developer focused then Drupal or Wordpress but it is still very easy to use.

## Deploy

I will tell you when I do it - this site was built on Hugo.
